## What is Typinator?  

**Typinator** is a professional **text expansion and automation utility** for macOS, developed by Ergonis Software. It‚Äôs designed to eliminate repetitive typing and improve productivity by automatically inserting frequently used text, phrases, and complex snippets anywhere you type.  

Whether you‚Äôre responding to emails, writing documentation, or coding, Typinator lets you create custom abbreviations that instantly expand into full sentences, paragraphs, or even formatted text. Its **smart expansion engine** works system-wide ‚Äî in any app ‚Äî and supports **Unicode, clipboard content, input variables, and scripts**, giving you the flexibility to automate virtually any repetitive task.  

Unlike traditional text expanders, Typinator includes **dynamic macros** and **marker-based automation**, allowing users to insert the current date, time, clipboard contents, or even run shell scripts within expansions. It also offers **auto-correction features**, **snippet sets**, and **multi-language support**, making it a versatile tool for writers, developers, and customer support teams alike.  

Built specifically for macOS, Typinator integrates seamlessly with the system‚Äôs input services, ensuring smooth and fast expansions with minimal CPU usage. Its clean interface, quick search, and real-time preview make snippet management effortless.  

With ongoing optimization for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** processors, Typinator remains one of the fastest and most reliable text automation solutions available for Mac professionals.
